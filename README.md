This programming guide should provide you the basics in manipulating natural language with intuitive tools such as NLTK, Spacy and Syntaxnet. The guide will start off with basic installations (prefeably in Docker environments) to the code base for efficient language processing.

This guide is also aimed at:
1. Building fundemental programming practices
2. Creating good stlying habits (PEP-8)
3. Deploy testing enviroment for code effeciencies.

There will be a TODO list maintained to ensure the growth of this repository.

** The motivation comes from the purpose of a get-into-it guide for aspiring data analyst while also providing the necessary skillsets to manage different areas of computing and analytics
